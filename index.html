        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>My name is Josh Keller. I'm from Gilbert, AZ and I come from a family
          of 7 people. I am the 2<sup>nd</sup> of 5 children. I was fortunate enough
          to be raised by the best parents ever: Curtis and Aimee Keller.
          I love my family!</p>
        <p> I recently returned from serving as a missionary in Colombia
          I mainly served in Barranquilla. It's a large city at 3 million people,
          but it's only claim to fame outside of Colombia is being Shakira's
           hometown. I also served in small town called Valledupar. Most people
           will live and die without every hearing about it. Unless, they like
           Vallenato.</p>
        <p> Since returning from my mission I have resumed my schooling at BYU
           I am BYU currently studying applied and computational mathematics
           (ACME).</p>
        <p> In my free, time, I enjoy running and biking.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Racite</b> - Racite is a new idea of mine. It would be a platform to help
            small races promote their event and coordinate sign-ups. It would allow
            them to create a race website without having to put in the time and effort
            to make their own website.
          </li>
          <li><b>Testing Ground</b> - Testing Ground is a site that diplays many different
            elements of html and css. It mainly serves as a reference guide for when I
            forget how to incoporate different elements into a website.
          </li>
          <li><b>Running Shoes</b> - Running Shoes is a database for different running shoes.
            As a runner, I love shoes, so I've decided to put them in an organized website.
            It also serves a similar purpose to Testing Ground (by that I mean testing out
            different elements of html and css), just in a much more organized manner.
