        <h1>Josh Keller</h1>
        <p>I'm Josh Keller. I'm from Gilbert, AZ and I come from a family
            of 7 people. I am the 2<sup>nd</sup> of 5 children. I recently
            returned from serving as a missionary in Colombia and I am BYU
            currently studying applied and computational mathematics at . I enjoy
            long-distance running and biking in my free time.
        </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Racite</b> - Racite is a new idea of mine. It would be a platform to help 
            small races promote their event and coordinate sign-ups. It would allow 
            them to create a race website without having to put in the time and effort
            to make their own website.
        </li>
        <li><b>Testing Ground</b> - Testing Ground is a site that diplays many different
            elements of html and css. It mainly serves as a reference guide for when I 
            forget how to incoporate different elements into a website.
        </li>
        <li><b>Running Shoes</b> - Running Shoes is a database for different running shoes.
            As a runner, I love shoes, so I've decided to put them in an organized website.
            It also serves a similar purpose to Testing Ground (by that I mean testing out
            different elements of html and css), just in a much more organized manner.
